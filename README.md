# X Grocery Store

This project is a personal portfolio website for my class CS 601 O1 final project at Boston University, showcasing resume, skills, and personal information. It is built using HTML, CSS and React with responsive layout.

Side notes: most of the styles were adapted from the previous assignment 3; most of the components are from the previous assignment 5.
